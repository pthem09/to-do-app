## Project overview

- Developed by Paul Them, 2024
- The website helps users keep track of interesting links or to-do items.
- Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- Ideas for improvements:
1. Allow users to sort items by category or priority.
2. Allow users to store added items in a database instead of local storage.
3. Allow users to undo deleted items, perhaps by creating a recycle bin.
4. Allow users to select different colors for different card categories.
